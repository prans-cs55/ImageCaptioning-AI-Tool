# ImageCaptioning-AI-Tool
📸 Image Captioning AI – Meaningful Names for Photos
🔍 Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered tool that generates meaningful captions for images. By transforming visual information into natural language, the tool enhances accessibility, searchability, and content management.

The application leverages the BLIP model from Hugging Face
 and provides a Gradio interface for easy interaction.

🎯 Project Objectives

Develop an automated image captioning tool that generates descriptive text for images.

Enhance photo organization by automatically naming and describing photos.

Support real-world applications, such as accessibility tools, image search, and security.

🛠️ Key Activities

Implement image captioning using the BLIP model.

Build a Gradio web interface for user-friendly interaction.

Enable caption generation from uploaded images or image URLs.

📚 Skills Required

Basic knowledge of Python

Familiarity with an IDE (like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook)

No prior experience with Hugging Face or Gradio is required — everything is introduced during the project.

🚀 Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

Hugging Face Transformers

BLIP Model

Gradio

🖥️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-ai.git
cd image-captioning-ai


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


(Your requirements.txt should include transformers, torch, and gradio)

Run the app

python app.py


Open the Gradio interface

The app will launch in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:7860/

📸 Example Usage

Upload an image or paste an image URL.

The model generates a caption like:

🖼️ Input: Photo of a dog running on grass
✍️ Output: "A brown dog running across a grassy field"

🎓 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

Understand generative AI models for image captioning.

Implement BLIP for image-text tasks.

Build a simple, interactive Gradio app.
